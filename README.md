The `jsob` (JavaScript Object Builder) script allows commandline construction
of JSON structures and inquiry into JSON value types.

A primary goal for this script is full support for nesting: the output of a call
to `jsob` should be able to be successfully incorporated into any other such
call, to facilitate the easy construction of complex objects.

To install, run `pip install [directory]`, or `pip install .` inside this repo.
